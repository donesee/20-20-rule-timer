20/20 Rule Timer
This simple timer was created to help me consistently follow the 20/20 rule: take a 1-minute break to look away from the monitor after every 20 minutes of screen time.

The timer features:

Customizable Time: Set your own custom durations if needed.
Countdown Display: A clear, real-time countdown of the remaining time.
Alarm Reminder: Plays an alarm when it's time to take a break.
Pause and Reset: Easily pause or reset the timer at any time.
I built this project as a personal productivity tool to reduce eye strain and stay mindful about screen breaks. Hopefully, it can be helpful to others too! ðŸ˜Š
